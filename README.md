# ðŸ”­  Hi I'm Itatiano! 
I have over a year of experience in the development area, I'm focusing on the backend but I'm learning a little bit of everything every day! 
What sparked my curiosity in the area was gamehacking, I liked studying how video game hacks worked, eventually this led me to coding.
My hoobies are playing games and everything related to music.<br>


ðŸ“– Studying at the moment: Python, Elixir<br><br>
