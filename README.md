# 🔭  Hi I'm Itatiano!
I have over a year of experience in the development area, I'm focusing on the backend but I'm learning a little bit of everything every day! 
What sparked my curiosity in the area was gamehacking, I liked studying how video game hacks worked, and eventually, this led me to coding.
My hobbies are playing games, ricing Linux, swimming,reading about topics that I like, and everything related to music, especially playing guitar.
I'm trying to get into pentest as a hobby but there's a lot of things that I need to learn atm<br>


📖 Studying at the moment: Vue, Nuxt, Salesforce Flow <br><br>
